And that was what was needed at the time.”</p>

                            <p>Bowie named this character “Ziggy Stardust” – first name taken from a tailor’s shop that he had spotted from a train. Ziggy was an omnisexual alien rock star sent to  Earth as a messenger of hope during humanity’s final 5 years of existence. He’s a wild, hedonistic figure, but at his core communicates peace and love. In the end, he is destroyed by his own excesses and by his fans.</p>
