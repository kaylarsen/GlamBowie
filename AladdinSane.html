                    <p class="text-block header__summary">Aladdin Sane was the moment David Bowie killed off Ziggy Stardust. According to Bowie, this was a monumental point in his career, “There was a point in ’73 where I knew it was all over, I didn’t want to be trapped in this Ziggy character all my life.” </p>

                            <p> It was the transformation from the somewhat playful and charming figure to  something darker and more disturbed. Aladdin Sane was Bowie gazing vacantly from an expanse of white nothingness while a lightning bolt slashes his face in two to conjure the schizophrenic symbolism of some faraway planet. This new darker character was the product of Bowie’s journey in America. The dregs of society inspired Bowie to innovate with the heavier themes of reality.</p>
